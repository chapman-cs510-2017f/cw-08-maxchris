# CS510 CW 8

**Author(s):** **Maksym Solodovskyi & Chris Watkins**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2017f/cw-08-YOURNAME.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-cs510-2017f/cw-08-YOURNAME)

## Specification

1. Copy your CW07 julia set modules into CW08. Modify your implementation so that it uses ```numba``` Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation to speed up your code, using the code block below as a guide. Specifically:
    * Import ```numba``` at the top of your module, in addition to ```numpy```.
    * When creating the ```julia``` function that transforms the entire complex plane, include a "decorator" (```@nb.vectorize```) just before your function definition to enable JIT compilation. (See below for the correct type signature.) 
    * Use the vectorization properly when applying the ```julia``` function to your complex plane as a ```numpy``` array (or ```DataFrame```). Note that if you called ```np.vectorize``` from ```numpy``` to vectorize your code before, this is no longer needed: the decorator for ```numba``` completely replaces this functionality by making your function a natively compiled ```ufunc``` directly.
1. In a notebook ```julia-benchmark.ipynb```, create a complex plane of size 5000 x 5000 points. First run your ```refresh``` method with the ```numba``` decorator commented out (and the ```numpy``` vectorization restored if necessary), and use ```%time``` to see how long your old implementation takes to compute the set (for an interesting ```c``` value that you like). Then uncomment the decorator to enable the JIT compilation with ```numba``` (removing the ```numpy``` vectorization if necessary), and again use ```%time``` to refresh the plane. How much faster does the code run after adding this one line of code? Detail your benchmarking investigation in your notebook.
1. More information about `numba` can be found here: [Numba Quickstart](http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/0.12.2/quickstart.html)
1. Work through the [Julia Overview Slides](http://slides.com/profdressel/julia-overview/). Create the appropriate notebooks and test functions as you follow along. Discuss and ask questions.

Example `numba` code:
```python
import numba as nb

@nb.vectorize([nb.int32(nb.complex128)])
def julia(z):
    # Your previous numpy code here
    pass

# Remove calls to np.vectorize if they exist elsewhere
```
## Assessment

We found that exploring numba was the most useful part of this assignment. The implementation was definitely faster and it is good to know to speed up code. Also the Julia slides were very helpful in learning Julia.

## Honor Pledge
